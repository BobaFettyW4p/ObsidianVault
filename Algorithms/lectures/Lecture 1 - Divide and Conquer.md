- Sorting problem
	- Given a list of objects, rearrange in r`[in|de]` creasing order
	- Input: An array `A[1..n]` of `n` real numbers
	- Output: Permutation `A'` of A such that $A'[1] \leq A'[2] \dots \leq A'[n]$
- Space complexity
	- in place
		- uses a constant amount of external storage
			- equal to the size of input array
