- closed form
	- nor having an algorithm express in terms of itself
- Recurrence: $T(n) = 2 T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$
	- each problem spawns two subproblems, each consisting of half the problem set, each instance performs O(n) work
	- merge sort
- Methods of solving recurrences:
	- Iteration method/recursion trees
	- Substition method
	- Master theorem
