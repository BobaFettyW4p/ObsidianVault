# Database Design
### Goals
- understand relational database
- evaluate relational database design
- create relational database diagram
- apply no

### The Relational Model
- data is represented as sets of *tables*
- tables have columsn and rows to store data, much like a spreadsheet
- attribute(column)
- tuple(row)
- relation(table)
### Keys
- each table in a relational database includes information that uniquely identifies a row in that table
	- every single row in a table must be uniquely identified by something
		- whether a single value, or the value of all of the columns
- Candidate key
	- can we used to uniquely identify a row
- Primary key
- Foreign key
	- way to make relations between dtaabases

### One to One relationships

### One to Many Relationships
- a single record in the first table can be related to many records in the second table, but  asingle record in the second table can be related to only one record in the first table

### Many to Many Relationship
- a single record in the first table can be related to many records in the second table and a single record in the second table can be related to many records in the first table

## Database Design Phases
- identifying and analyzing user requirements
- develop a conceptual data model
- evaluate and perform normalization
- choosing a DBMS
- devleop the logical modle-writes schema
- develop the physical model

### Establishing table structure
- a table within the database represents each subject
	- each table is composed of fields, which represent the characteristics that define or describe the subject of the table

product table
product ID: product ID
product name
quantity
components


components table
component ID: primary key
name
description
suppliers
products used in

suppliers table
primary key: supplier ID
supplied components


### Entity-Relationship Model
- a semantic model, captures meanings
- coneptual level model
- proposed by Peter Chen in the 1970s
- **Entities**: real-world objects about which we collect data
- **Attributes**: describe the entities
- **Relationships**: associations among entities
- represented by ER diagrams
	- *Entity Relationship Diagram*

### ERD Conncetors
- entities at the top, attributes at the bottom
### Normalization
- the process of decomposing large tables into smaller ones in order to eliminate redundant and duplicate data, and to avoid problems with inserting, updating, or deleting data


### Anomalies
- an anomaly 

### Normalization Levels
- differnet levels from weakest to strongest:
	- first normal form (1NF)
	- second normal form (2NF)
	- third normal form (3NF)

#### First Normal Form (1NF)
- each column must have a unique name
- the order of the rows and colums don't matter
- each column must have a single data type
- no two rows can contain identical values
- each column must contain a singl evalue
- columns cannot contain repeating groups
	- domains of attributes are *atomic*: no sets, arrays, lists, repetaing fields, or groups allowed in domains
