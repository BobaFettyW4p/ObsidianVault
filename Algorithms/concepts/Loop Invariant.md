- a statement that we use to prove the correctness of iterative algorithms that use loops
	- bears a passing resemblance to inductive proofs
- 3 steps to prove
	- Intiialization - proves the Loop Invariant is true initially prior to the 1st iteration
	- Maintenance - If the loop invariant is true prior to one iteration, it will remain true after the current one and prior to the next
	- Termination - The loop invariant is true when the algorithm terminates
