# Prompt
>"You are given a directed graph $G = (V,E,w)$ with nonnegative weights and a designated subset $U \subset E$ of unpaved edges. You may traverse at most one unpaved edge during your path from $s$ to $t$.

### Part a
>"Construct a graph $G'$ such that a standard Dijkstra run on $G'$ enforces the "at most one unpaved edge" constraint

## Part b
>"If $|U| = k$, how many additional edges or nodes does your construction add?

### Part c
>"Briefly explain why your construction guarantees correctness"
